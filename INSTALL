Installing Ylva is easy. Ready made packages are available for example on Debian stable. 
If you're running Debian or Ubuntu (21.04 or later) you can simply install Ylva with command
sudo apt install ylva.

There are also package in FreeBSD ports, I don't use FreeBSD so I don't know how to install ylva
from the ports. It's probably very easy.

Please note, that packages might not give you the latest stable version of Ylva.

How to install Ylva from the source code?

You need development libraries for Sqlite, OpenSSL and libqrcodegen. You will also need 
a modern C compiler and GNU Make.

On Fedora:

sudo dnf install sqlite-devel openssl-devel libqrcodegen-devel
cd into Ylva source directory and type commands:

make
sudo make install

Now you should be able to start Ylva by typing ylva in your terminal.
