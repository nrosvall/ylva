# Ylva - Command line password manager

## NOTE: Ylva is not maintained anymore by me. If you want to take over, please do!

Password management belongs to the command line, deep into the Unix heartland,
the shell.

Ylva is written in C and is licensed under the MIT license. Ylva is mostly developed
on Linux, but should work on BSD too.
